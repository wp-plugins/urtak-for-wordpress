== Description ==

[Urtak](https://urtak.com?from=wordpress_plugin) is collaborative polling — everyone can ask questions. It's easy to engage a great number of people in a structured conversation that produces thousands of responses.

= Powered by the people =
By letting everyone ask questions, you’ll discover answers to questions you never thought to ask. 

= Structured engagement =
Presented as a series of simple Yes/No questions, Urtak provides instant data and organizes opinions into a useful resource.

= Easy moderation =
Filter spam and bad questions out automatically with community moderation, or approve them manually without leaving the WP dashboard.

= Ask the right questions =
Our algorithm prioritizes questions so that the most cared about ones are presented first.

= Instant Results =
View immediate results to any question without leaving your WordPress dashboard.
    
= Back-end Analytics =
All the information generated is structured and easy to parse at Urtak.com. Link directly to your Urtak dashboard to view your comprehensive data.

== Installation ==
After installing the plugin from the WordPress Plugin Directory, proceed to activate the plugin. Just enter your email address, if you’re a new user, we’ll sign you up automatically and generate an API key for you. If you already have an account we’ll help you retrieve your key. Hit ‘Let’s Get Started’ and you’re ready to go. 

= Settings =
Settings can be modified at any time at the Urtak Configuration page, just click ‘Toggle Advanced Options’ to see them. By default, an Urtak will be created whenever a user visits your page. It’s loaded in the background and won’t slow your page down. If you prefer, you can opt out, and an Urtak will only be created when you kick off the conversation by asking a question in the Post interface. The Urtak widget appears underneath your content, but you can opt to place it on your page manually. Questions will be automatically approved by community moderation, which prevents manual moderation of each user-submitted question. If you deselect this option, an e-mail will be sent each time a question is submitted and you must approve or reject it manually.     

= Using the Plugin =
When you create a new post, a new Urtak is automatically generated that can be moderated at anytime within the Post interface. It is simple to get started. Simply enter a few questions into the question box and you’re ready to go. The more questions your audience answers, the better insight you get and you can keep them answering by making each question simple, but entertaining. Return to the Edit Post interface at anytime to moderate questions by approving, rejecting or marking them as spam. To view results, either visit the widget on your published page or your dashboard on Urtak.com where all of your data is stored and organized.
